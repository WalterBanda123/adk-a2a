# Stock Inquiry Feature Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Overview

Added the ability for users to ask about stock levels in the transaction chat, making the system more conversational and helpful for inventory management.

## âœ… What Works Now

### Stock Inquiry Patterns

Users can ask about inventory using natural language:

**General Inventory Queries:**

- `"What's my inventory?"`
- `"Show me all my stock"`
- `"Check inventory"`
- `"List my current inventory"`
- `"What products do I have?"`

**Specific Product Queries:**

- `"How much bread do I have?"`
- `"What's my stock of mazoe orange crush?"`
- `"Do I have any raspberry juice?"`
- `"Check my bread stock"`

### Smart Response Types

**Complete Inventory Overview:**

- Shows total product count
- Categorizes by stock status (In Stock ðŸŸ¢, Low Stock ðŸŸ¡, Out of Stock ðŸ”´)
- Lists products with quantities and units
- Provides stock alerts for low/out-of-stock items

**Specific Product Information:**

- Shows exact stock quantity with units
- Displays current price
- Shows stock status with color-coded indicators
- Handles fuzzy matching for product names

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

2. **`extract_product_from_stock_query(message)`** - Extracts specific product names
3. **`handle_stock_inquiry(message, user_id)`** - Processes and formats stock responses

### Integration Points

2. **Real-time Data**: Always shows current inventory levels
3. **Smart Detection**: Automatically distinguishes between sales and inquiries
4. **Rich Formatting**: Color-coded status indicators and organized information
