## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Start Today!)

### **Step 1: Collect Training Images** (Priority 1)
```bash
# Use your phone/camera to take photos of:
# 1. Hullets Brown Sugar (different angles, sizes)
# 2. Mazoe products (Orange, Raspberry, etc.)
# 3. Common grocery items in your store
# Goal: 50-100 images to start

# Upload using our script:
python upload_images.py ./my_photos staples
python upload_images.py ./beverages beverages
```

### **Step 2: Label Your Images** (Priority 2)
```bash
# Open and edit training_data_template.csv
# For each image, add 4 labels:
# - brand (e.g., "Hullets")
# - product_name (e.g., "Brown Sugar") 
# - size (e.g., "2kg")
# - category (e.g., "Staples")

# Example line:
# gs://deve-01-automl-training/images/staples/sugar.jpg,brand,0.1,0.1,0.4,0.3
```

### **Step 3: Train Your Model** (Priority 3)
```bash
# When you have labeled 50+ images:
python automl_training_pipeline.py

# This will:
# 1. Upload your training CSV
# 2. Import data to AutoML dataset
# 3. Start model training (6-24 hours)
```

### **Step 4: Monitor & Deploy** (Priority 4)
```bash
# Check training progress:
python check_training_status.py

# When training completes, deploy model:
python check_training_status.py  # Will prompt for deployment

# Monitor system:
python automl_monitoring.py
```

## 🛠️ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

### **Start Your Enhanced System:**
```bash
# Production startup:
./start_automl_production.sh

# Or manually:
python direct_vision_server.py
```
