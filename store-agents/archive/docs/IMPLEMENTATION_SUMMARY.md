- `message`: Human-readable response
- `overview`: Structured data for dashboards
- `products`: Array of product objects
- `requires_attention`: Boolean for alert systems

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

### User-Specific Data
- Products are filtered by `store_owner_id` = `user_id`
- Each user only sees their own store's inventory
- Session-based user identification

### Comprehensive Stock Status
- **Healthy Stock**: Items above reorder point
- **Low Stock**: Items at or below reorder point
- **Out of Stock**: Items with 0 quantity
- **Total Inventory Value**: Calculated automatically

### Frontend-Ready Responses
- Formatted messages for direct display
- Structured data for custom UI components
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Natural language understanding

## ðŸ“‹ Product Data Structure
Each product includes:
- `product_name`, `category`, `brand`
- `stock_quantity`, `reorder_point`
- `unit_price`, `cost_price`
- `supplier`, `last_restocked`, `expiry_date`
- `store_owner_id` (matches user session ID)

## ðŸ§ª Testing
- Use `test_stock_frontend.html` to test the integration
- Run with your actual user_id from sessions
- Test different query types and natural language variations

## ðŸš€ Implementation Status
âœ… Backend agent system ready
âœ… Stock level queries working
âœ… User-specific filtering implemented
âœ… Natural language processing enabled
âœ… Frontend integration examples provided
âœ… Test interface created

Your frontend can now seamlessly ask the agent about stock levels using the user_id from your session management, and the agent will provide comprehensive inventory information specific to that user's store.
